# LibroMovies - Technical Assessment Front-end Developer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

This project consists of building **LibroMovies**, a simple web application that has a catalog of the most popular films.

This application has only 2 pages.

### Pages

_Page 1 - List of movies_

This screen consists of displaying a list of movies with at least: - Film cover - Movie title

_Page 2 - Film Detailing_

This screen consists of the movie detail after selecting a movie from screen 1​.
Consider for this screen the use of the greatest possible amount of
information.

## Requirements

- Implementation of movie listing functionality
- Implementing a movie detail functionality
- Using @angular​ in its version 2 or higher
- Using @angular/material
- Use of The Movie Database web service for listing, detailing and/or any other non-mandatory features
- Use of responsiveness to ensure visualization nice also on mobile devices

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
